Global AI Ethics and Governance Observatory
Getting AI governance right is one of the most consequential challenges of our time, calling for mutual learning based on the lessons and good practices emerging from the different jurisdictions around the world.

The aim of the Global AI Ethics and Governance Observatory is to provide a global resource for policymakers, regulators, academics, the private sector and civil society to find solutions to the most pressing challenges posed by Artificial Intelligence.

The Observatory showcases information about the readiness of countries to adopt AI ethically and responsibly.

It also hosts the AI Ethics and Governance Lab, which gathers contributions, impactful research, toolkits and good practices.
